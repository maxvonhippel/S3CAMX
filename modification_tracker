Changes made in this branch which should be merged to Master:

  (1) Fixed pathcrawler's seemingly false constraints in traces
  - DESCRIPTION: The trace output from pathcrawler can have constraints in the `Path Predicate'
    section which are false. This is due to the floating point numbers not being printed to the
    precision equivalent to eclipse's internal representation.
  - SOLUTION: Assume any trivially False constraint to be True.
