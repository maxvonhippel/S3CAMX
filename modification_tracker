Changes made in this branch which should be merged to Master:

  (1) Fixed pathcrawler's seemingly false constraints in traces
  - DESCRIPTION: The trace output from pathcrawler can have constraints in the `Path Predicate'
    section which are false. This is due to the floating point numbers not being printed to the
    precision equivalent to eclipse's internal representation.
  - SOLUTION: Assume any trivially False constraint to be True.
  - FILE: ./path_crawler_helpers/prep_trace.py
  - TAG: FP_TRUE

  (2) Added the support to initialize the matlab plant using Matlab's classes
  - DESCRIPTION: Matlab plant simulators had to call init() inside the sim() call to load_system().
    This is now supported by using classes, similar to Python simulators. Moreover, 
    the modifications are backwards compatible. psim.py uses internal logic to detect if the
    supplied matlab simulator file is a class or a function and takes appropriate actions. This is
    planned to be removed in the future. Should probably not merged with the main branch?
  - SOLUTION:
      -Added init_plant.m
      -Copied simulate_plant.m to simulate_plant_fun.m
      -simulate_plant.m was modified to work with classes. This adds the feature to call init()
  - FILE modified: ./psim.py, ./simulate_plant.m
  - TAG: CLSS
