plant state:
  region of phase space

controller state:
  current symbolic state
  path constraint: 
    sequence of controller paths taken
    sequence of plant states [how important is this??: can we ignore it?] can be made arbitrarily
    important , but how important in reality?

total state:
  current plant state
  current controller state

states are equal iff:
  plant state is the same
