run ./setup.sh to compile


NOTES:

    - Have some understanding, but not sure if pxd,pyx,py files are 100% OK
    - setup.py and setup.sh have something missing, because the shared
      lib generated by Matlab is not being compiled along the sources
      by Cython

    FIXED!!
    - Main issue was pxd for some reasons. Including the correct
      header files fixed the linking with the .so. Earlier, for some
      reasons, the linker was not linking against the .so at all.
